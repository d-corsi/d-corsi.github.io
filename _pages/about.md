I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Verona, advised by [Prof. Alessandro Farinelli](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~farinelli/). I worked as a visiting student under the supervision of [Prof. Guy Katz](https://www.katz-lab.com/) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

My **Research interests** focus on developing novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods applied to robotics, with a particular emphasis on the generation of reliable systems in safety-critical contexts. I try to analyze this problem from two different perspectives: (i) safe training via **constrained reinforcement learning**, and (ii) validation via **formal verification of neural networks**. 

As an essential aspect of my work, I constantly try to merge theoretical research with practical application to real-world robotic problems. For more information on my research activity, you can visit the [publications page](https://d-corsi.github.io/publications/).
