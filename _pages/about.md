I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [University of California: Irvine](https://uci.edu), in the [Intelligent Dynamics Lab](https://indylab.org) under the supervision of [Prof. Roy Fox](https://royf.org). Previously, I worked as a visiting researcher under the supervision of [Prof. Guy Katz](https://www.katz-lab.com/) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I obtained my PhD at the University of Verona advised by [Prof. Alessandro Farinelli](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~farinelli/).

My **research interests** centers on advancing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for robotics, with a focus on creating safe and reliable systems in critical settings. I tackle this from two sides: safe training through **constrained reinforcement learning** and validation with **formal verification of neural networks**. Lately, I’ve also been diving into **model-based RL** and **world modeling** —- working toward systems that can not only react but also predict what’s next. Merging theory with real-world robotic challenges is key to my approach, aiming to push boundaries in practical, forward-looking AI. For more information on my research activity, you can visit the [publications page](https://d-corsi.github.io/publications/).
