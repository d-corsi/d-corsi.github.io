I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [University of California: Irvine](https://uci.edu), in the [Intelligent Dynamics Lab](https://indylab.org) under the supervision of [Prof. Roy Fox](https://royf.org). Previously, I worked as a visiting researcher under the supervision of [Prof. Guy Katz](https://www.katz-lab.com/) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I obtained my PhD at the University of Verona advised by [Prof. Alessandro Farinelli](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~farinelli/).

My **research interests** center on advancing deep reinforcement learning for robotics in safety-critical settings. I work on both sides of safety: training-time methods (**constrained RL** and **safety shields**) and post-training assurance via **formal verification of neural networks**. Recently, I’ve been integrating **foundation models** (LLMs and VLMs/VLAMs) with RL for robotic control, and developing world models so agents can not only react but **predict**. A key focus is sim-to-real transfer and low-latency deployment on real platforms (drones, manipulators, aquatic robots), with an emphasis on measurable reliability and open, reproducible artifacts. My goal is to bridge theory and practice to deliver robust systems with clear safety guarantees. For more, see the publications page.[publications page](https://d-corsi.github.io/publications/).
