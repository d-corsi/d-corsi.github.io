&emsp;**July**

- Excited to share two new papers this month! âœ¨ Our work *"Analyzing Adversarial Inputs in Deep Reinforcement Learning"* has been accepted at **AISoLA 2025**. You can find it <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05284.pdf'>here</a>. Another highlight: *"Efficient Dynamic Shielding for Parametric Safety Specifications"* has been accepted at **ATVA 2025**! You can read it <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22104.pdf'>here</a>.  

&emsp;**June**

- Really excited to kick off my participation in the <a href='https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/safron'>DARPA SAFRON project</a> ðŸ¤–.  
  In this project, we will investigate how to integrate foundation models (LLMs, VLMs, and VLAMs) for robotic control, with a special emphasis on the **safety** of these systems. These models cannot simply be treated as black boxes, and Iâ€™m thrilled to explore new ways to make them safer and more reliable!

&emsp;**May**

- Thrilled to announce that our paper *"Explanations for Unrealizability of Infinite-State Safety Shields"* has been accepted at **KR 2025** ðŸŽ‰. You can check it out <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23603.pdf'>here</a>.  

&emsp;**February**

- Our paper *"Realizable Continuous-Space Shields for Safe Reinforcement Learning"* has been accepted at **L4DC 2025** ðŸš€. See the paper <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02038'>here</a>.
