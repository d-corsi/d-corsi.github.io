      year: 10/2019 - 05/2023
      work_title: "Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning: Enhancing the Reliability of Intelligent Systems"
      abstract: My PhD thesis was advised by Prof. Alessandro Farinelli and focused on developing novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods applied to robotics, with a particular emphasis on the generation of reliable systems in safety-critical contexts. My research interests center on two critical aspects that form a unified process for creating trustworthy intelligent agents. The first aspect is the adoption of constrained reinforcement learning techniques for safety-oriented training, and the second is the verification of neural networks for model validation.

      work_title: "Experimental evaluation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Approaches: Application to a Redundant 7DOF Manipulator"
      abstract: My first step into Deep Reinforcement Learning was taken during my master's thesis. The goal of the work was to develop a neural network controller for the Franka Emika manipulator, with an emphasis on safety aspects. Part of the thesis has been published at IRC, 2020.
